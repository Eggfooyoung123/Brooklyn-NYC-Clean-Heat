## Introduction

The NYS Clean Heat initiative, emissions data for Brooklyn, essential demographic information, and an in-depth analysis, with graphs, of the gathered information are provided by each site on this platform. It explores the fundamental details of the clean heating systems in various neighborhoods of Brooklyn, such as Borough Park, Flatbush, Brooklyn Heights, Prospect Heights, and Ocean Parkway.

## Summary of Borough Overview

To understand the area better, we explored the demographics of five neighborhoods in Brooklyn: Borough Park, Flatbush, Brooklyn Heights, Prospect Heights, and Ocean Parkway. We also researched how different clean heat programs from New York affected our data interpretation. The DEP Boiler Registration Program and the Clean Heat Program were some of these programs. Additionally, we explored the greenhouse emissions of NYC and the role of Brooklyn as the most populous borrough in contributing to them. We encountered the Types of Fuel Oiul (No.4 and No.6), where No.6 was revealed to create more environmental destruction due to it being heavy fuel for power plants and ships. Such claims from our research are proven to be correct, as all the neighborhoods had higher values of No.6 fuel oil, contributing to higher fuel usage.
